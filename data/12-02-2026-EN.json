    "content": "Next comes the camp on the **west side** of the Tabernacle. On this side stood **Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin**, with **Ephraim leading** this division. The total number of men able to go to war on this side was **108,100** (Numbers 2:18-24). Like the other sides, this was not a random grouping.\nGod was teaching His people through direction, names, and position. Every side of the camp carried a lesson for the journey.\n\nLet us first look at the meanings of the names. **Ephraim** means *doubly fruitful*. **Manasseh** means *causing to forget*. **Benjamin** means *son of my right hand*.\nThese three names together form a powerful message. Fruitfulness, forgetting, and exaltation. God places these tribes on the west side, and through this arrangement He quietly shows how fruitfulness is connected to leaving the past behind, and how true exaltation comes after that.\n\nIn Hebrew thinking, the west has a strong meaning. One common word used is **Yam**, which means *sea*. Because the Mediterranean Sea lies west of Israel, many verses say “toward the sea” where English Bibles translate it as “toward the west.” Another word connected with west is **Achar**, which means *behind* or *what comes after*. The west is also the place where the sun sets. Light disappears from view. Because of this, the west often carries themes such as the past and what is left behind.\n\nIn Scripture, the sea often represents restless nations, multitudes of people, and chaos. Revelation uses the sea to picture the troubled world system. The sea is unstable, always moving, never at rest. So when west is connected with the sea, it often reminds us of the old world; full of noise, pressure, fear, and confusion. The west becomes a picture of what lies behind us as we move toward God’s purpose.\n\nNow let us look at the spiritual lesson. During this journey of ours, God calls us to be **doubly fruitful**, like Ephraim. Jesus did not say we should bear little fruit. He said, “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit” (John 15:8). Fruitfulness means a life that produces love, obedience, holiness, and good works that glorify God. It also means making spiritual impact beyond ourselves. But fruitfulness does not happen by holding on to the past.\n\nThat is why **Manasseh** stands next to Ephraim. Manasseh means *causing to forget*. This does not mean forgetting lessons or wisdom. It means forgetting the old life that once ruled us. Paul says, “Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before” (Philippians 3:13).\n\nWe cannot walk forward while looking backward. We cannot be fruitful in the new life while clinging to the old world. The west, where the sun disappears, becomes a picture of letting the old ways fade out of our sight.\n\nThis also connects with how Scripture speaks about the world. Revelation describes the world system as restless like the sea. When God calls us to forget, He is calling us to stop being shaped by that chaos. He is calling us to set our minds on things above, not on things of the earth (Colossians 3:2). Just as the sun sets in the west, the old desires, old ambitions, and old identity must fade. Only then can true fruitfulness grow.\n\nWhen fruitfulness and forgetting come together, the result is **Benjamin**; the *son of the right hand*. In Scripture, the right hand represents strength, authority, favor, and honor. Jesus Himself is seated at the right hand of the Father (Psalm 110:1; Hebrews 1:3). Christ bore much fruit for the Father. He lived fully for God. He let go of earthly glory and endured the cross. Because of this, God exalted Him and placed Him at His right hand. Christ became the perfect Son of the right hand.\n\nThis same pattern applies to us. When new creation believers bear fruit and forget the old life, God prepares them for honor in the age to come. Scripture says that God will raise us up and seat us together with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6). Revelation speaks of those who overcome sitting with Christ on His throne (Revelation 3:21). This is not pride; it is promise. It is God’s reward for faithfulness. We do not earn it by works, but we walk into it through obedience and endurance.\n\nThere is also a beautiful echo in Psalm 45. It says, “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty” (Psalm 45:10-11). This psalm speaks of a bride who forgets her old house and enters into a new relationship with the king. Spiritually, this points to the church. When the church lets go of the old world and lives fully for God, she is prepared for glory. In this picture, Christ stands as the Bridegroom, and the church becomes the beloved who is brought near.\n\nSo the west side of the camp teaches us a deep lesson. God calls us to fruitfulness, but fruitfulness requires forgetting. Forgetting leads to transformation. Transformation leads to honor. The journey does not end in the chaos of the sea. It moves beyond it. What is behind must stay behind. The sun sets on the old life so that a new day can rise ahead.\n\nJust as this was true for Christ, it is true for us. Christ bore much fruit.\nHe endured. He let go of earthly life. He was exalted. In the same way, when we live as new creations, bearing fruit and leaving the past behind, God prepares us for resurrection life and fellowship with Christ. The west side is not a place of loss. It is a place of transition. It is where the old fades, so the eternal can begin.\n\nSo let us take this lesson into our hearts. Let us pursue fruitfulness with patience. Let us forget the chaos of the old world. Let us keep our eyes on the promise ahead. God is faithful to complete what He has begun. When the journey is finished, those who were fruitful and faithful will be called sons of the right hand, sharing life and glory with Christ forever."
