Hold a sacred assembly and deny yourselves,[a] and present a food offering to the Lord. 28 Do not do any work on that day, because it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the Lord your God. 29 Those who do not deny themselves on that day must be cut off from their people. 30 I will destroy from among their people anyone who does any work on that day. 31 You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live. 32 It is a day of sabbath rest for you, and you must deny yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to observe your sabbath.”"

    "content": "As we continue from yesterday’s Morning Light, our hearts are still resting on the Day of Atonement and the journey of the new creation. We saw how the High Priest in Israel entered the Most Holy Place once a year, and how this pointed forward to Christ and to the final completion of the new creation’s path. Today, we pause over two small but powerful details that God Himself chose: the 10th day and the 7th month. These are not accidents on the calendar.\nIn Scripture, numbers are often accompanied with meanings, and here Yahweh quietly teaches us about testing, completion, and the moment when the Bride of Christ is fully ready.\n\nGod did not choose the 9th or the 11th day, but very specifically the 10th day of the 7th month as the Day of Atonement. Again and again in the Bible,\nthe number ten carries the thought of full measure, full responsibility, full test. The Ten Commandments are the most familiar example. In them we see the complete summary of God’s righteous requirements for Israel. Ten becomes a kind of “full set” in moral matters: full obligation, full standard. When God sets the Day of Atonement on the 10th day, it is like saying, “This is the day of full account, full value, full proving.” By this time, no more days can be added; the measure has reached its appointed fullness.\n\nOur Lord also used the number ten in a beautiful way in a parable about a woman and her silver coins. In Luke 15:8-10 He speaks of a woman who has ten silver coins and loses one. She lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and searches carefully until she finds it. In the culture of that region, a bride often wore a headdress with ten silver coins as part of her dowry and adornment. Those ten coins were not random money; they were precious tokens of her honour, beauty, and completeness as she prepared to be presented as a bride. Spiritually, we may see in this a picture of the Bride of Christ, the overcomer class, adorned with a complete “set” of graces and faithfulness. Each coin can be thought of as a feature of character, humility, loyalty, obedience, patience, love of truth, and of course the royal commandment of Love which is the completion of the Law. Ten coins together show nothing lacking. The picture is of a Bride fully adorned, fully tested, ready to stand beside her Bridegroom.\n\nIn that light, the 10th day of the 7th month becomes more than a date. It speaks of the moment when the Bride has come through her full test, when every “coin” that the Lord counted necessary has been formed and polished in her character. By the antitypical 10th day, the new creation overcomers have reached the end of their proving. They have been faithful over what was entrusted, like the faithful servant in Luke 19:17 to whom the Master says, “Well done, good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.” Their life of faith, suffering, service, and obedience has reached its full measure. The day of atonement for them is the day when this full value, through grace, is acknowledged and sealed by the Lord.\n\nWe notice also that this Day falls in the 7th month, the month Tishri.\nIn the sacred calendar of Israel, that month is rich with holy days: the Feast of Trumpets on the 1st, the Day of Atonement on the 10th, the Feast of Tabernacles beginning on the 15th. Seven in Scripture is the number of completion, rest, and perfection. God completed His creative work in six days and rested on the seventh. The seventh day became the Sabbath, the day of rest. The seventh year was a sabbatical year when the land rested. After seven cycles of seven years came the fiftieth year, the Jubilee. So, when we see the seventh month filled with solemn gatherings, we are meant to think of completion and rest at a higher level.\n\nIf we look at the long history of mankind, Scripture and prophecy allow us to see the ages as seven great “days” of a thousand years each. The permission of evil and the Gospel Age together occupy roughly six thousand years.\nThese form, in picture, six days of toil, darkness, and learning under the reign of sin and death. The seventh “day,” the seventh thousand-year period, corresponds to the Millennial reign of Christ. It is the great Sabbath day of God’s plan, the time of rest, healing, blessing, and restoration for the world.\nThe prophets saw that during this Millennial age the knowledge of the YAHWEH would cover the earth as the waters cover the sea, and when no one would say, “I am sick,” because the people would be forgiven and taught.\n\nIn this sense, the seventh month, Tishri, can be seen as a picture of that seventh thousand-year period. It is the “month” in which Kingdom arrangements are set up, judgment proceeds, and the final harvest of both the Church and the world is worked out. And the Day of Atonement, sitting on the 10th day of this 7th month, points to a special moment inside that larger period. If the 7th month stands for the Kingdom age, then the 10th day within it pictures the completion of the Church, the 144,000. During this seventh thousand-year “day,”\nthe first resurrection of the faithful Church is completed. They stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion, as Revelation 14:1 describes, having His Father’s name written in their foreheads. Their sacrifice is finished; their testing is over;\ntheir atonement is fully applied to them in glory.\n\nThere is a beautiful link here with the Jubilee law given in Leviticus 25.\nGod commanded that on the fiftieth year, liberty was to be proclaimed throughout all the land. Debts were released, inheritance lands returned,\nand bondmen were freed. The sound that announced this Jubilee was not blown on any ordinary day. The command was very exact: “Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the Day of Atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land” (Leviticus 25:9). Again we see the same three markers: the 10th day, the 7th month, the Day of Atonement, and now the Trumpet of Jubilee.\n\nIn the antitype, this gives us a strong and tender picture. When the Church is fully glorified, when the last member of the new creation has “finished the course” and the full number is gathered, then the great Jubilee of earth moves to the next phase of redeeming the remaining class of people and the world. The Day of Atonement for the Church closes; the trumpet of Jubilee for the world opens. Through that completed, glorified Church, together with their Head, Christ Jesus, real liberty from sin, death, bondage, and ignorance will start to flow to all mankind “throughout all the land.” The blessings promised in Abraham’s seed will at last begin to reach every family of the earth.\nThe seventh month points to the age; the tenth day points to the completed value of the new creation’s sacrifice. Together they mark the turning point when heaven’s work in the Church is finished and heaven’s work for the world can move into it’s next phase.\n\nSo, we may gather these thoughts in our hearts. The 7th month reminds us that we are in the great Sabbath period of God’s plan, the Kingdom “day” in which Christ’s reign and judgment are being set in order. The 10th day reminds us that there is a definite, complete end to the testing of the overcomer class.\nWhen that point is reached, when the Bride’s “ten coins” are all in place, when nothing more needs to be added to her character and faithfulness, then the Day of Atonement for the new creation concludes. The 144,000 stand with the Lamb, ready to rule the nations with an iron rod, to share the throne of Christ, to judge the world and to judge angels. From that moment, the trumpet of Jubilee will sound in a way the world has never heard before, and the long night of mankind’s slavery will finally give way to the morning of freedom.\n\nWith this quiet assurance, we see that the details of “ten” and “seven” are not dry numbers but gentle signposts in God’s calendar of love. They tell us that the testing is not endless, the race is not without a finish line, and the plan is not uncertain. The new creation’s path, though narrow and steep, leads to a day when the value of every hidden tear and every faithful step is fully recognised. And beyond that, a whole world waits for its Jubilee."

We praise Thee that the testing of the new creation will one day be finished, and his Bride will stand complete before Thee.\n\nWe thank Thee for the promise of the first resurrection through Christ and the coming age that will free all creation from bondage. We confess that our hearts are longing to see Thee face to face, to dwell in Thy presence without veil, fear, or distance. Keep us faithful till that day, Father, that we may stand before Thee with joy, giving Thee all honour, through our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
