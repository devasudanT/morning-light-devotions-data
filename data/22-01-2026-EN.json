    "content": "After speaking about houses and fields, Yahweh continues in Leviticus 27:25-34 with four strong themes: the sanctuary measure, the firstborn, devoted things that cannot be redeemed, and the tithe. At first glance, these topics may feel like separate rules. But together they teach one clear message: God is not only asking for gifts; God is declaring ownership. God is not only teaching giving; God is teaching lordship. God is not only shaping the hands; God is shaping the heart.\n\nLeviticus 27:25 speaks about the “shekel of the sanctuary.” Every valuation must be measured by the official standard. The spiritual meaning is that holy things must be handled with holy measure. In the world, people change weights to gain advantage. Scripture says, “A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight” (Proverbs 11:1). God’s house must not be ruled by dishonest scales. For the new creation, the sanctuary shekel becomes the reminder that our spiritual life must be measured by God’s standard, not by human opinion. We do not define holiness by culture.\nWe do not define truth by popularity. We do not define devotion by feelings. The Word of God is the measure. “Thy word is truth” (John 17:17). When our conscience becomes loose, when compromise feels normal, the sanctuary shekel calls us back. God’s standard does not change.\n\nThen the LORD speaks about the firstborn in Leviticus 27:26-27. No man can sanctify the firstborn to the LORD, whether ox or sheep, because it already belongs to the LORD. “For it is Yahweh’s.” This is a precious principle: some things are not offered as optional devotion because they are already God’s by right. God does not accept the firstborn as if it were a special favor from man. God says it was His from the beginning. This firstborn theme runs through Scripture. “Sanctify unto me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:2). The firstborn carries the idea of rightful claim.\n\nFor the new creation, this speaks loudly. Our life is firstborn property.\nWe are not our own. We do not become God’s only after we feel spiritual.\nWe become God’s because Christ purchased us. “Ye are bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). Even our “best” is not something we proudly present as if God should be impressed. Our best already belongs to Him. Our first love belongs to Him. Our first strength belongs to Him. Our first days belong to Him. And Christ Himself is called “the firstborn among many brethren” (Romans 8:29), and also “the firstborn from the dead” (Colossians 1:18).\nIf Christ is the Firstborn, then those who are in Christ belong to God in a firstborn way. Hebrews speaks of “the church of the firstborn” (Hebrews 12:23). This means the new creation is not living as ordinary ownership.\nThe new creation lives as God’s portion.\n\nLeviticus then speaks about what is “devoted” in a way that cannot be redeemed (Leviticus 27:28-29). This is a severe category. It is not the same as a normal dedication vow that can be redeemed with added value. This “devoted” category carries the meaning of something set apart completely and finally. Spiritually, it reminds us that some decisions become final in God’s government. It also reminds us that holiness is not always negotiable. There are moments when God’s judgment is fixed and not reversed. In the new covenant, we feel this solemn warning when Hebrews says that willful, continued sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth is dangerous, and it speaks of fearful judgment (Hebrews 10:26-27). This does not cancel mercy for the repentant, but it warns against playing with grace. God is loving, but God is also a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29). The new creation must not treat the sacrifice of Christ like a common thing.\n\nNow the chapter ends with the tithe in Leviticus 27:30-34. “All the tithe of the land… is the LORD’s: it is holy unto the LORD.” If a man redeems any part of his tithe, he adds the fifth part. The animal tithe passes under the rod, and the tenth is holy. It cannot be exchanged for better or worse, and if it is exchanged, then both become holy. The spiritual meaning is strong: God’s portion is not to be adjusted by human preference. God’s holy things are not to be swapped as if worship is a business deal.\n\nFor the new creation, the tithe teaches ownership and trust. Under the law, Israel had structured tithes connected with worship and national life. In the new covenant, the Church is not placed under the Mosaic system as a legal contract, yet the principle remains: God owns all, and giving is worship,\nnot loss. Scripture says, “Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase” (Proverbs 3:9). The New Testament calls giving a matter of heart and grace. “God loveth a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7). It teaches regular and planned giving: “Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store” (1 Corinthians 16:2). It teaches generosity toward need: the early believers shared and supported one another (Acts 2:44-45).\nThe new creation gives not to become righteous, but because righteousness has been given. The new creation gives because love rules the heart.\n\nThe “no exchange” principle also has a deep application. God is not pleased when we give Him what costs nothing, while keeping the true treasure for self. David said, “Neither will I offer… unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing” (2 Samuel 24:24). When the heart tries to swap devotion, it is often because the heart still wants control. Ananias and Sapphira show the danger of pretending full devotion while hiding part in hypocrisy (Acts 5:1-5). God desires truth inwardly. The tithe law, with its strict holiness, pictures the call to sincerity.\n\nWhen all these laws are read together, they become a mirror for the new creation. God’s standard must measure us, not human standards.\nGod’s ownership must rule us, not self-ownership. The firstborn principle reminds us that life belongs to God already. The devoted-things principle warns us not to trample holiness and not to play with grace. The tithe principle trains the heart to honor God first, not last, and to treat holy things as holy.\n\nThis leads to a final and necessary call. The new creation is called to perseverance. The narrow path is not walked for one season; it is walked to the end. Jesus said, “He that endureth to the end shall be saved” (Matthew 24:13). The end of Leviticus is not only a list of rules; it is a picture of a faithful life. Holy things must stay holy. Vows must stay honored. The heart must stay true. Until the last breath."

    "text": "Our Holy Father, we thank You that You are a God of truth and holy measure. Place Your sanctuary standard in our heart, so that we may not be shaped by the world’s false scales. Remind us that we are not our own, because we have been bought with a price. Keep us from treating Your grace lightly, and keep us from a heart that tries to bargain with holiness. Teach us to honor You with our lives, to give with joy, and to live with sincerity. Strengthen us to endure to the end, and to hold what is holy with reverence until our last breath. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
