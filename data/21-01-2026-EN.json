    "content": "Leviticus 27 ends the book with a gentle but serious theme: what belongs to the LORD must be treated as holy. In the earlier chapters, Yahweh taught Israel about sacrifices, priests, holiness, clean and unclean, and the appointed feasts. Now, at the close, he teaches about dedication, valuation, redemption, and ownership. This is not a small matter, because it touches daily life. It touches homes, property, work, inheritance, and money. God is showing that devotion is not only a feeling inside the heart; devotion is also decisions, priorities, and faithfulness in what is owned and handled.\n\nIn Leviticus 27:14-15, the LORD begins with a house. If a man sanctifies his house to be holy unto the LORD, the priest will estimate it, whether it is good or bad, and the priest’s estimation will stand. If the one who sanctified it wants to redeem it, he must add the fifth part of the money of the priest’s estimation. Then the house becomes his again. The first spiritual lesson is simple: a house can be offered to God, but it cannot be offered with confusion. God gives order. God gives a priestly valuation. God gives a fixed path for redemption. This teaches that devotion must be honest and clear, not emotional and careless.\n\nFor the new creation, the deeper meaning becomes even more personal. Scripture teaches that the body is a temple. “Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you… and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). If the house in Leviticus can be sanctified, how much more the “house” of our life must be sanctified.\nOur thoughts, our habits, our private choices, our screens, our speech, our time, our sleep, our relationships, and our spending all sit inside the “house” of daily living. To sanctify the house in the new covenant means that Christ is welcomed as its Master, not as a guest. It also means that nothing in the house is treated as “small” if it dishonors Him. This house was brought at a price, very costly. The blood of Christ.\n\nThen Yahweh moves from a house to a field. In Leviticus 27:16-21, a man may sanctify part of the field of his possession unto the LORD. The valuation is measured with fairness, connected to seed, and it is counted “according to the years” remaining until the Jubilee. If the man redeems the field, he adds a fifth part and keeps it. But if he does not redeem it, and if it is sold to another man, then it shall not be redeemed anymore. When the Jubilee comes, the field does not return to the original owner. It becomes holy to the LORD, “as a field devoted,” and it becomes the priest’s possession.\n\nHere a key question rises, and it is the one that must be understood carefully: how will the land belong to the priest, how, when, and why? The “how” is through sanctification that becomes permanent by refusal to redeem, and by transfer that closes the door. The “when” is at the Jubilee, the year of release, when inheritances are reset. The “why” is because what has been set apart to the LORD and left unredeemed is treated as holy property, and in Israel the priesthood represented the LORD’s house and service. The priest did not receive a tribal land inheritance like the other tribes. The LORD said of the priests, “Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land… I am thy part and thine inheritance” (Numbers 18:20). Again it is written, “The LORD is their inheritance” (Deuteronomy 18:1–2). Yet the priests still needed provision to live and serve. Therefore, certain holy portions supported them. In this specific law, a hereditary field that is sanctified and then left unredeemed becomes,\nat Jubilee, a holy possession tied to the LORD’s service, and it becomes the priest’s.\n\nThere is also a moral wisdom here. God is preventing games with vows.\nA person could not sanctify a field, enjoy the honor of sounding spiritual, then later treat the vow lightly, or shift the property around to escape the seriousness. The Jubilee reveals what is true. If redemption is refused, and if the field is treated like a sale item after it was sanctified, then at Jubilee the field is no longer treated as ordinary inheritance. It becomes holy, and it becomes the priest’s possession. God is teaching that words spoken before Him cannot be used as empty religion. “God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (Galatians 6:7).\n\nFor the new creation, this field has a strong spiritual meaning. Scripture says, “Ye are God’s husbandry,” meaning God’s field (1 Corinthians 3:9). Our life is a field where seeds are planted and fruit is expected. Our decisions are sowing. Our habits are sowing. Our friendships are sowing. Our thoughts are sowing. “He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting” (Galatians 6:8). To sanctify the field in new covenant language is to say, “All that we are, and all that we do, belongs to Yahweh.” It includes our work our plans and future, our talents and opportunities. It also includes our inheritance; whatever God has placed into our hands to manage.\n\nThe “redemption plus one-fifth” principle carries spiritual meaning as well.\nIn Leviticus, adding a fifth shows that redemption is not done cheaply. It is not done with excuses. It is done with a real cost. For us, redemption is ultimately by Christ alone, because “we have redemption through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). Yet when repentance is real, repentance also carries fruit. Zacchaeus said, “If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold” (Luke 19:8), and Jesus responded with joy because true repentance was visible. The fifth part in Leviticus reminds us that when sin has damaged others, repentance is not only tears; repentance becomes obedience, restitution, and changed direction. “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance” (Matthew 3:8) is the spirit of this law.\n\nLeviticus 27:22-24 adds another case: a field that is not part of a man’s inherited possession, but a field he bought. If he sanctifies that purchased field to the LORD, the priest values it “even unto the year of the jubilee.” The man gives the money the same day as a holy thing unto the LORD. But in the Jubilee, the field returns to the one whose inheritance it originally was. This is important because it shows that God protects the original inheritance boundaries. Sanctifying a purchased field does not cancel the rightful return at Jubilee.\nIn other words, devotion does not become a legal trick to steal an inheritance. God’s holiness never supports injustice.\n\nFor us, this speaks about stewardship with humility. The new creation understands that everything in life is received. Even when we “buy” something, we still live inside God’s world, on God’s earth, breathing God’s air, living by God’s mercy. “The earth is the LORD’s, and the fulness thereof” (Psalm 24:1). So the new creation learns to hold possessions lightly and to hold devotion honestly. The believer gives to God not as a way to control God, but as a response to God. We are stewards, not owners. We manage what is in our hands, but we do not claim what is not ours.\n\nThe Jubilee itself gives a powerful spiritual picture. Jubilee is release, restoration, and return. Jesus read Isaiah and said, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me… to proclaim the acceptable year of Yahweh” (Luke 4:18-19).\nIn Christ, a greater Jubilee begins. Captives are released from sin. Debts are canceled by the cross. Inheritance is restored in the new covenant. Yet Leviticus also shows that Jubilee reveals what was truly redeemed and what was left behind. So for us, the final day, the day of Christ, will reveal what was surrendered and what was pretended. Our life is now the field. We are also his house. Our choices now are the seeds. What is holy will remain holy. What is empty will be exposed.\n\nSo this part of the law teaches a deep and gentle truth: God receives dedication, but God also guards dedication. God allows sanctifying, but God demands honesty. God provides redemption, but God does not allow the vow to be treated like a toy. And God shows that holy things, left unredeemed, become permanently separated for His service."

Sanctify us, so that our sowing is to the Spirit and not to the flesh. Keep us from making vows that are only sound and not substance.\nTeach us to be faithful stewards, to repent with fruit, and to honor You in what we own and what we do. May our devotion be ordered by Your Word and filled with Your love. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
