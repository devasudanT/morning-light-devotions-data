    "content": "For the last two days we studied the first part of Leviticus 26. We saw Yahweh’s command to keep His Sabbaths and to show reverence for His sanctuary,\nand we saw the blessings Yahweh promised if Israel would walk in His ways. Those blessings were real promises for Israel’s life in the land. But they were also a shadow; like a picture drawn ahead of time - pointing to the Peaceable Kingdom of Christ. That coming age is when the whole earth will taste what true “Sabbath” means: not only one day of rest, but a world brought into right order under righteous rule.\n\nThe prophets speak about that future rest in very gentle words. Isaiah says, “The effect of righteousness will be peace… My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places” (Isaiah 32:17-18). Psalm 72 describes the reign of the righteous king and says, “In his days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace…” (Psalm 72:7). And Hebrews tells us that there is still a future rest ahead: “There remains… a Sabbath rest for the people of God” (Hebrews 4:9-11). This helps us understand Leviticus 26 in a deeper way. Yahweh was not only teaching Israel farming and national safety. He was showing what His Kingdom looks like when His righteousness fills the earth; peace, security, quietness, and rest.\n\nIn that Peaceable Kingdom, the resurrected mankind will not only be alive again, but will be taught, trained, healed, and brought into obedience.\nToday, the human heart is weak, stubborn, and easily pulled into sin.\nBut the prophets say Yahweh will change hearts and guide people into His ways. Through Ezekiel, Yahweh says, “I will give you a new heart… and cause you to walk in My statutes” (Ezekiel 36:26-27). Isaiah says, “The earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh” (Isaiah 11:9). Another prophecy says the nations themselves will come to learn: “He will teach us His ways… that we may walk in His paths” (Isaiah 2:2-3; also Micah 4:1-2). Psalm 22 also reaches far and wide: “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Yahweh… and worship…” (Psalm 22:27-28). Jeremiah adds a tender promise: “I will give them one heart… that they may fear Me forever… I will not turn away… to do them good” (Jeremiah 32:39-40). These verses show that the Kingdom is not only about outward peace; it is about inward renewal. People will learn to love what is right and to reverence Yahweh from the heart.\n\nNow think again about one special blessing from Leviticus 26: seasonal rains. Yahweh promised Israel rains in their season so the land would produce (Leviticus 26:4). In the Bible, rain is more than weather. Rain often becomes a picture of Yahweh’s Word and his teaching; something that comes from heaven, softens the dry ground, and causes life to grow. Isaiah says, just as rain and snow come down and water the earth so it produces seed and bread, Yahweh’s Word is like that: it goes out and accomplishes what He intends (Isaiah 55:10-11). Moses also speaks this way: “My teaching shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew” (Deuteronomy 32:2). Hosea adds,\n“He will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain that waters the earth” (Hosea 6:3). Rain refreshes the soil and brings growth. In the same way, Yahweh’s Word refreshes the heart and brings change.\n\nSo what does it mean when we say, “Rain is God’s Word”? It means Yahweh’s teaching comes from Him, not from man. It means His Word enters hearts that are dry or dead. It means His Word produces fruit of; repentance, faith, obedience, and good works. It also teaches patience, because rain is not instant. It keeps coming, season after season, until the seed becomes a harvest.\nAnd rain often falls widely. One rain can water a whole region. In the Peaceable Kingdom, Yahweh’s Word will go out to the whole earth. People will not be left in darkness. They will be taught, corrected, comforted, and led.\n\nWhen the rain comes, the land becomes fruitful. That is exactly what Leviticus 26 promised: crops, fruit trees, and abundance. And Scripture also uses farming as a picture of spiritual growth. Jesus said the Kingdom is like seed growing quietly: the farmer does not know how, but the seed sprouts, grows, and then comes harvest (Mark 4:26-29). The Peaceable Kingdom will be like that on a world scale. Yahweh’s Word will be planted in human hearts. Those hearts will slowly change. People will learn righteousness. And the earth itself will become like a well-watered field, not only physically, but also morally and spiritually.\n\nThe Bible also uses the image of a tree for a righteous person. Psalm 1 says the one who delights in Yahweh’s law is “like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields its fruit in its season” (Psalm 1:1-3). That is what Yahweh has been waiting for in mankind: the true fruit. And the greatest fruit is not wheat or grapes; it is the fruits of the Holy Spirit, the character that grows when the heart is shaped by Yahweh’s Word and Spirit. When the Peaceable Kingdom trains the world in righteousness, humanity will begin to produce the kind of fruit God desired from the beginning: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. The earth will not only be full of crops; it will be full of a changed people.\n\nSo the “seasonal rains” and “abundant harvests” in Leviticus 26 are not only old covenant blessings. They are a window into God’s future purpose.\nThey show a world where Yahweh’s Word flows, where hearts are taught, where righteousness grows like a tree by rivers, and where peace rests on the land like a gentle covering. Leviticus 26 continues with more blessings, and it also contains warnings when people refuse Yahweh’s ways. We will continue in the next part and see how Yahweh unfolds the rest of this covenant chapter."
