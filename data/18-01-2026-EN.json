    "content": "Yesterday we saw about a voluntary vow; an act of devotion where a person could dedicate himself, or someone in his household, to Yahweh. We also saw God’s wisdom in giving a valuation system, so devotion would be real, but people would not be harmed or exploited. We ended with an important question: Hannah vowed her son Samuel to God, but she did not “buy him back.” Did she break the Law?\n\nTo answer this, we must first remember something simple but important. Not every vow in the Bible is the same kind of vow. Leviticus 27:1-8 provides a regulated method for a vow that is fulfilled through valuation payment. It does not say, “Every vowed person must always be redeemed.” It gives a just and orderly system for vows that were handled in that way. God was preventing chaos and injustice, and He was providing a path for devotion to be honored.\n\nHannah’s vow, however, was not merely a vow to pay a valuation. Hannah’s vow was a vow of lifelong dedication. In 1 Samuel 1:11 she said, “O Yahweh of hosts… if thou wilt… give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.” That “no razor” language connects with Nazirite consecration (Numbers 6:5). Hannah was not speaking about a sanctuary payment. She was giving her son to the Lord’s service for life.\n\nWhen God answered her prayer, Hannah did not delay or change her mind.\nShe waited until Samuel was weaned, and then she brought him to Shiloh.\nShe spoke with peace and firmness, “For this child I prayed… therefore also I have lent him to God; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to God” (1 Samuel 1:27-28). Hannah fulfilled her vow. She did not break it. In fact, she became an example of the very principle we learned: it is better not to vow than to vow and not pay.\nHannah vowed, and she paid; not with silver, but with obedience and surrender.\n\nWe must also ask another practical question. Was it lawful for Samuel to serve at the sanctuary? The Bible shows Samuel ministering before Yahweh under Eli (1 Samuel 2:11, 18). Later genealogies also connect Samuel’s family line with the Levites\n(1 Chronicles 6:33-38). Whether one reads the event as God appointing Samuel under Eli’s oversight, or also notices the later family records, the point remains clear: Hannah’s vow was not lawless. It was not careless. It was not emotional drama.\nIt was devotion guided by faith, carried out with patience, and fulfilled with reverence.\n\nThis teaches us something very deep. Leviticus shows us a devotion that is regulated and protected. Hannah shows us devotion that is surrendered and faithful. Both are pleasing to God, because both honor His holiness. Leviticus says that devotion must not become harmful. Hannah shows that devotion must not become half-hearted. Leviticus provides mercy for the poor. Hannah shows courage to give what is precious. Together they teach us that true dedication is not a show. It is not a loud promise. It is a quiet life that fulfills what it says.\n\nThere is another truth shining behind all of this. Israel could dedicate a person and pay a regulated price in silver. But in the fullness of time, Christ did not dedicate us with silver; He redeemed us with His own precious blood. Scripture says we are not redeemed with corruptible things like silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19). If God treated Israel’s vows with such seriousness, how much more should we treat the redemption that cost heaven so much. We do not dedicate ourselves to earn salvation. We dedicate ourselves because salvation has already been given, and love must answer love.\n\nSo what is the call for us today? Let our words before God be truthful. Let our promises be few but faithful. Let our devotion be sincere, but let it also be wise and ordered. Let us not pressure others with vows, and let us not make spiritual promises that our life does not carry. And when God gives blessings, deliverance, or answers to prayer, let us respond not only with excitement, but with obedience. This is the devotion that remains. We will study about this more in our tomorrow’s morning light."

    "text": "Our Holy Father, we thank You for teaching us through Your Law and through the lives of Your servants. We thank You for the wisdom that protects devotion from harm, and we thank You for the faithfulness that fulfills what is spoken. Teach us to be people of truth. Help us to dedicate ourselves to You with a clean heart, without pride, without pressure, and without emptiness. Give us grace to keep our commitments, and humility to repent when we fail. Above all, help us to remember the price of our redemption, and to live as those who belong to You. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
