    "content": "When we come to Christ, we do not only receive forgiveness; we enter a covenant life. This life is not built on casual words or momentary emotions. \n\nIt is built on vows that shape the whole journey of faith. These vows are not always spoken aloud, yet they are real, binding, and holy. The New Testament does not remove the seriousness of vows; instead, it moves them from the temple treasury into the heart, from silver and weights into life and obedience. As new creation believers, our vows are not paid once and finished. They are lived every day, until the final breath.\n\nOne of the greatest vows of the new creation is the vow of a living sacrifice.\nThe apostle Paul writes, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service” (Romans 12:1). In the old covenant, a sacrifice was placed on the altar and died once. In the new covenant, the sacrifice remains alive, yet surrendered. This means our time, strength, choices, desires, ambitions, and future are placed before God daily. A living sacrifice does not belong to itself anymore. It does not decide its own direction. It stays on the altar, even when the fire burns.\n\nThis vow is not symbolic poetry. It is practical obedience. To live as a sacrifice means that our life is no longer shaped by self-will, but by the will of God.\n\nPaul continues by saying, “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Romans 12:2). The vow of a living sacrifice demands a transformed mind. Old patterns must die. New thoughts must be formed by truth. Without this transformation, the sacrifice slowly crawls off the altar.\n\nAnother foundational vow of the new creation is expressed openly in baptism. Baptism is not only a testimony; it is a covenant act. Scripture says, “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?” (Romans 6:3). When we went into the water, we vowed to die with Christ. When we came out, we vowed to walk in newness of life.\n\nPaul explains, “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death… even so we also should walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\n\nThis means baptism carries a lifelong vow: to die to self, to bury the old nature, and to refuse the rule of sin. It is written, “Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin” (Romans 6:6). To crucify the old nature is not a one-day experience.\nIt is a daily choice. Jesus Himself said, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23).\nThe cross is not carried once; it is carried every day.\n\nHere we must stop and examine our journey on the narrow path. How far have we fulfilled this vow? Have we truly buried the old man, or have we allowed him to rise again? Paul warns believers, “Make not provision for the flesh,\nto fulfil the lusts thereof” (Romans 13:14). Yet the flesh is clever. It hides in plain sight. It seeks comfort, recognition, and control. When we excuse sin, feed old passions, or compromise with the world, we are not merely failing morally;\nwe are breaking a covenant vow.\n\nThe danger of not fulfilling these vows is clearly written in Scripture.\nPaul warns that those who live after the flesh will die spiritually (Romans 8:13). Jesus warns that not everyone who says “Lord, Lord” will enter the kingdom,\nbut only those who do the will of the Father (Matthew 7:21). The danger is not loss of words, but loss of transformation. When vows are spoken but not lived,\nthe heart becomes dull. Conscience becomes weak. Love grows cold.\nThis is why the narrow path remains narrow. It guards life.\n\nYet the goal of these vows is not fear; it is transformation. God’s desire is not only that we stop sinning, but that we are changed into His likeness.\nScripture says, “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son” (Romans 8:29). The image of Christ is the pattern of the new creation. As we behold Him, we are changed. “We all… beholding as in a glass the glory of the Yahweh, are changed into the same image from glory to glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nThis transformation goes even deeper. Christ Himself is the exact image of God. Scripture says He is “the image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15).\nAs we are conformed to Christ, we are being restored to the image of Yahweh that was lost through sin. This does not mean we become Yahweh, but that we reflect His nature, holiness, love, truth, righteousness, and faithfulness.\nJesus said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). This is not human perfection, but maturity in God’s nature.\n\nThose who walk in this transformation are called the new creation. “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). The new creation is not a title; it is a life.\nIt is the Church described as the body of Christ. It is also described prophetically as those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes (Revelation 14:4). Scripture speaks of the 144,000 as those in whom there is no deceit,\nwho are blameless before God, and who belong fully to Him.\n\nThis raises an honest and sobering question. Are we there yet? Are we fully transformed? The answer, for most of us, is that we are on the way. Paul himself said, “Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:\nbut I follow after” (Philippians 3:12). The Christian life is a pressing forward.\nIt is holding the vow through struggle, failure, repentance, and renewal.\nWhat matters is not perfection in a moment, but faithfulness to continue.\n\nThese vows are not seasonal. They do not expire. They are held until the last breath. Jesus said, “He that endureth to the end shall be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Paul, at the end of his life, could say, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith” (2 Timothy 4:7). This is the voice of a man who kept his vow. Not without weakness, but without turning back.\n\nSo let us remember what we have vowed. We vowed our whole life as a living sacrifice. We vowed death to self in baptism. We vowed to crucify the flesh and follow the Spirit. We vowed to be transformed into the image of Christ.\nThese vows are not fulfilled by words, but by actions. Day by day. Choice by choice. Until the end."

    "text": "Our Holy Father, we come before You remembering the vows we have made in Christ. We confess that we are weak, yet we desire to be faithful. Help us to remain on the altar as living sacrifices. Give us grace to die to self daily, to crucify the old nature, and to walk in newness of life. Transform our minds and our hearts until the image of Christ is formed in us. Keep us on the narrow path, and strengthen us to endure until the last breath. May our life truly belong to You, now and forever. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen."
